# Procedure to run the code

1. Run the "Model_updated.ipynb" file.
2. Update the locations for the real and fake data folders in the code. (G-Drive link for the data set: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o2h-dJZY5DUUOp2XkaH_58BjGuXDabdx?usp=drive_link)
3. This should take some time to run since there is lot of data and epochs.
4. After execution, "model_final.h5" file should be created in your respective working directory.
5. Use the model file path in the "Updated cod for predition final.ipynb" file.
6. This should give us the input prompt to give the image path along with generic inputs.
7. Output will be given in text and voice format.
8. You can use "flask_app.py" for UI.
